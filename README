This is my dev repo for my personal home page please do not edit without permission.
DONE:
- load rss feeds on page load: 'onload="getRSS();"' type thing
- load links as <a href="chan_link">link</a>

- load rss part of page periodically without reloading the whole page
- bg img


TODO:
- scoll the rss feeds ala google dynamic feed controler(would be nice)
- todo list form with check boxes for status od items
- reminders list with ability to add/remove items through page
